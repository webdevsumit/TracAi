# TracAi

Through this, we tried to build something that can convert any tractor into AI-POWERED tractor.

We built that in a hackathone in 36 hours.
We were not able to get data to train the model so we decided to detect edges and with some calculations, find the path and use that.
we broke down that into multiple levels:
1. Detect the edge of the plowed field to move the steering.

2. Detect the edge of the front of plowed field to stop the tractor.
3. Rotate tractor by 90 degree or according to the field by calculations.
and continue these steps to drive tractor in a spiral path.

We successfully completed above 2 steps in the hackathone but we were not able to complete 3rd step on time.
As we used the Toy tactor in the hacathone and that was too fast steering raduis was too less and front wheels were too big hence we achieved some level of accuracy but that was not just okay.

If you think we should build this together or start a company to automate any kind of tractor at low cost then please contact.
